# Learning Git and Github

## Optional Overview of Version Control

* When working with digital files, whether is a .docx word file or a programming .py Python file, you probably don't finish all your work at once.
* In this case, the software you use to manage and track changes in these files is your **Version Control**.
* **Git** itself is one example of a **VCS**, and while there are others(Subversion,mercurial,etc..),**Git** is by far the most popular **VCS** in the world.
* Fortunately for us **Git** is free and open-source and we can download it to our own computer.
* What is **GitHub**?

    * You can use git completely free locally, and use it to track changes on your local files on your own computer.
    * However if you want to host your code on the internet, its typically easier to use a hosting service like **Github**.

* **Github** Vs **Git**

    * **Git** - open source VCS Software
    * **Github** - Company that operates a service for hosting files on the internet that are managed using git.

# Starting with Git
 
- **Git** typically refers to the entire project and **git** is the actual program used.

- Git itself is hosted on the website https://github.com/git/git

- Github provides many features especially graphical interfaces of many git features.

## Configure Git
 
* Configuration commands 
    * **git config --global user.name "user"**
    * **git config --global user.email "email"**

## Creating and Cloning Repositories

- The place where we track changes and manage our files which are using Git is called **Repository**.

- How can we create a Git Repository?

    * git init - initializes a Git Repository
    * git status - will report back the status of git repository.
    
- git init -> .git -> inside folders

* Create the local repository at command line 
* Then use **git clone** to clone to our local machine.
